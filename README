This projects deals with 2 datasets related to public and private transportation. 

In the first section (Improving_ETA) we do a deep exploration of ETA estimation in order to improve the current benchmark. We do feature generation and we apply several Classification and Reggression models.

The second project (Fare_prediction) looks at a different dataset in order to make accurate Fare predictions of taxi rides.
