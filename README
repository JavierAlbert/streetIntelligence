This projects deals with 2 datasets related to public and private transportation. 

In the first section (Improving_ETA) we do a deep exploration of ETA estimation in order to improve the current benchmarks using Classification and Reggression models.

The second project looks at a similar (but different) dataset in order to make accurate Fare predictions of taxi rides.
